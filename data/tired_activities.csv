Take a warm bath with essential oils
Make yourself a cup of chamomile tea
Do 10 minutes of gentle stretching
Wrap yourself in a soft blanket and just rest
Try a guided relaxation meditation
Apply a cool face mask and lie down
Listen to a calming podcast or audiobook
Give yourself a gentle hand or foot massage
Dim the lights and set a relaxing atmosphere
Write down tasks for tomorrow so you can let go of them tonight
