Write in a journal about how you're feeling
Take a long, warm shower or bath
Watch a sad movie (sometimes it helps to cry it out)
Go for a quiet walk in nature
Wrap up in a cozy blanket with a warm drink
Listen to rain sounds or calming nature sounds
Look through old photos that bring back good memories
Call a supportive friend or family member
Practice gentle yoga or stretching
Create some art expressing how you feel
